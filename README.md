# Materialize Portfolio Website
> A basic HTML/CSS portfolio webpage mainly using Materialize CSS framework.

The concept with the website is to create a portfolio website using a Card-Based Web Design using a
Material Design CSS Framework and Library called [Materialize](materializecss.com/getting-started.html).
It provides HTML code, CSS and Javascript, making it much easier to get started with web development.

## Get started

### 1. Install/pick an editor/IDE

This short course will use **WebStorm**, it is not required, but I absolutely recommend it because (1)
it makes coding much easier with many tools and add-ons that are extremely practical, and (2) a powerful
tool that is FREE(!) for students. However you need to [register](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) with your UiO-email
and you'll have access to many other products from Jetbrains. **Highly recommended!**

Alternatively other editors (Sublime/Atom/Brackets etc.) work perfectly fine too, but if you want to learn how
to use WebStorm in the same process, then :thumbsup:    

### 2. Install necessary packages

The first packages that need to be installed prior is (1) [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html)
files and apply (i.e enter email) to get access to (2) [Font Awsome](http://fontawesome.io) which requires a very quick email
registration process. The remaining/other packages are installed as we code...

## Step-by-step instructions


### 0. Get inspired

The very first step before we make something is deciding "what" to make. We decide on a design
and structure that will determine the look and feel of our website. This can be a very hard thing to
do, but luckily there are many resources that can help us with this. A page that I often use and
recommend is [UpLabs](https://www.uplabs.com). This have many concepts and ideas that we can use to
make great websites. Another good one is [Designspiration](https://www.designspiration.net).

The design we are going to build from is this one..


### 1. Setup index.html

    .
    ├── css
    ├── images
    ├── init                    # This is folder we start from..
    │   └── index.html          # This is the file we start with...
    ├── js
    ├── index.html
    ├── README.md
    └── work.html

The repository folder contains the structure listed above, and to get started we
will work from the `init` folder. Inside init we have `init/index.html`. This is
our basis.

### 2. Choose palette

We need to choose a theme, and to do that we need at most a **primary** color and an **accent** color.
This is also something that can be hard, but if we have performed step 0 - [Get inspired](#get-inspired), then
you probably have somewhat an idea. [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/color.html) have their own color palette, which showcases the
colors they have created, but we don't need necessarily need to use these. But however, if
we want to use the Materialize colors there is a... (you guessed it).. a tool to help us. This is called
[Material Design Palette](https://www.materialpalette.com). This is a very nice tool, with an icon register as well :star:

On the other hand if we want to use define our own colors, I recommend using [Coolors](https://coolors.co) :thumbsup:

### 3. Choose font

Now Materialize has already defined a font for us, called "Roboto", this is the standard font
for this framework, but since we want to personalize our website, we have to pick a font
that goes along with our style, and guess what?.... THERE'S A TOOL THIS :tada::100: This is [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com).
It helps us to easily choose and import cool fonts to work with.

### 4. Start coding

Inside `init/index.html` we have our starting point, and from here we start coding..

```
...
    <div class="container">
        <!--- START HTML CODE-->


        <!-- END HTML CODE -->
    </div>
...

```

We start with a container, and because the Materialize CSS handles all the padding and margins for us.
The main idea with this is that we get get a grouping for our code, and it also makes
it easier to style our page afterwards :wink:
