# Materialize Portfolio Website
> A basic HTML/CSS portfolio webpage mainly using Materialize CSS framework.

The concept with the website is to create a portfolio website using a Card-Based Web Design using a
Material Design CSS Framework and Library called [Materialize](materializecss.com/getting-started.html).
It provides HTML code, CSS and Javascript, making it much easier to get started with web development.

## Get started 

1. Install an editor/IDE

This short course will use **WebStorm**, it is not required, but I absolutely recommend it because (1)
it makes coding much easier with many tools and add-ons that are extremely practical, and (2) a powerful
tool that is FREE(!) for students. However you need to [register](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) with your UiO-email
and you'll have access to many other products from Jetbrains. **Highly recommended!**

Alternatively other editors (Sublime/Atom/Brackets etc.) work perfectly fine too, but if you want to learn how
to use WebStorm in the same process, then :thumbsup:    

2. Install necessary packages  

The first packages that need to be installed prior is (1) [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html)
files and application to get access to (2) [Font Awsome](http://fontawesome.io) which requires a very quick email
registration process. The remaining/other packages are installed as we code...
